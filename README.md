BLACK JACK (with AI)

Blackjack with AI

Project Overview

The Blackjack with AI project is an interactive card game simulation where the game is played between human players and an AI-controlled dealer. The project leverages artificial intelligence, including Monte Carlo methods and Q-Learning, to enable the AI to learn and adapt its strategy based on the game state. The system is implemented in C++ and includes components for game logic, AI algorithms, a graphical user interface (GUI), and a database for tracking scores and learning data.

Features

Card Game Logic: Implements the rules and mechanics of Blackjack.

AI Decision Making: Utilizes Monte Carlo simulations and Q-Learning for reinforcement learning.

GUI: Provides a visual representation of the game using OpenCV or Qt.

Database Integration: Tracks player statistics and AI learning outcomes using SQL.

Learning and Adaptation: AI improves its decision-making over multiple games through trial and error.

System Architecture

1. Game Logic

Card Deck: Represented as a shuffled collection of cards.

Player and Dealer: Each has a hand of cards, with actions such as hit, stand, split, and double down.

Scoring Rules: Implements Blackjack scoring, including handling of aces.

2. AI Implementation

Monte Carlo Simulation:

Simulates random games to evaluate the probability of success for various actions.

Updates a decision-making policy based on outcomes.

Q-Learning:

Reinforcement learning technique where the AI learns optimal strategies through rewards.

States: Player’s hand value, dealer’s visible card.

Actions: Hit, stand, etc.

3. GUI

OpenCV or Qt: Visual representation of cards, scores, and game prompts.

Interactive Gameplay: Users can interact with the game through the GUI.

4. Database

SQL Integration:

Tracks player performance and AI learning history.

Stores statistics and game outcomes.

How It Works

Game Initialization:

A shuffled deck is created, and cards are dealt to players and the dealer.

Player Actions:

The player chooses actions (hit, stand, etc.) based on their hand and visible dealer card.

AI Decision Making:

The AI calculates the optimal move using Monte Carlo and Q-Learning algorithms.

Over time, the AI refines its decision-making through reinforcement learning.

Game Resolution:

The winner is determined based on the rules of Blackjack.

Database Update:

Game results are recorded, and AI learning parameters are updated.
